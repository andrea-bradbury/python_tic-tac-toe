Noughts and Crosses Game - Python Assignment

**Task**:
Develop an OOP analysis of noughts and crosses with a GUI.

This game allows for the user to play the computer. 

**Assumptions and guidelines**:
The user is X and always goes first.

The game handles inputs of numbers to choose the user's move on the board.

If an invalid place is selected the user can enter a place again.

**Simple AI assumptions**:
The computer's turn is determined by 3 scenarios:
- A place where O will win
- A place where X will win (to defensively guard that spot)
- Otherwise select a corner position
    - The program also contains a safeguard for the computer to chose the first available place on the board.
    (This should never actually be used but is a good back up for piece of mind).

**Finishing a game**:
The game handles wins by either the user, computer or a draw scenario.

To exit the game the user just needs to click the screen.
